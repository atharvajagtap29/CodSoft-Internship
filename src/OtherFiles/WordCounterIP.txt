Titanic is one of the finest piece of cinemetography, story-telling, romance, acting, music. Titanic is the closest movie i have to my heart as Titanic is the first Hollywood movie that i saw. As Titanic lies at the bottom of the Atlantic, she is gonna lie at the bottom of our hearts too. Rest peacefully dear Titanic.
